## **Project Overview**
As part of the Bright Network Technology Academy, we were assigned a group project to research, plan and develop a Full-stack project - a chat app in 10 days.

### **This Website Features**
- Login functionality
- Registration
- Add/remove friends
- Chat with friends
- Switch chats

## **Setup and Instructions for using the Project**

1. This Full-stack project runs on React and Express. Make sure you have Node and MongoDB installed to run the API and React. We used VSCode for this project.
2. Create a MongoDB database named chatapp with the following terminal commands:
```mongosh```
```use chatapp```
3. Clone [Chat App](https://github.com/joaopulsz/messaging-app.git) by typing the following commands into your terminal:
```git clone git@github.com:joaopulsz/messaging-app.git```. Open in VSCode.
4. Within VSCode, navigate your terminal to the `express.js_server` folder and run the following two commands:
```npm install```
and
```npm start```
5. Navigate to the `react.js_app` folder and run the following two commands:
```npm install```
and
```npm start```
6. Navigate to your web browser and if it has not already displayed, enter in the following URL:
```http://localhost:3000/```
